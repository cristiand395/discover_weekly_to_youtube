"""
This script imports songs from a user's Spotify Discover Weekly playlist and saves them to a YouTube playlist.

To use this script, the user must have a Spotify account and a YouTube account with a playlist created. The user must also
have the necessary API credentials for both Spotify and YouTube.

The script first authenticates the user with both APIs and retrieves the user's Discover Weekly playlist from Spotify.
It then searches for each song on YouTube and adds it to the user's YouTube playlist.

This script was created as part of a project to automate the process of saving songs from Discover Weekly to YouTube.
